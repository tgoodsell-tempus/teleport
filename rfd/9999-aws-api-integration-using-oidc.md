# RFD 999 - AWS API Integration using OIDC

## Required Approvals

* Engineering: @ryanclark && @r0mant
* Product: @xinding33 || @klizhentas
* Security: @reedloden

## What

Integrate with AWS using an OIDC IdP.

#### Goals

Ease the AWS resource discovery and onboarding.

This feature must work for OSS, Enterprise and Cloud customers.

#### Non-goals

Having a real OIDC IdP.
That initiative can be tracked [here](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/20967).

Automatically onboard AWS resources into Teleport.

## Terminology

* OIDC: OpenID Connect is a protocol that works on top of OAuth2 and provides identity information.
* IdP: Identity Provider is a system that manages identities.
* JWT: JSON Web Token is a json encoded token that contains a set of claims signed by an entity.
* JWKS: JSON Web Key Set is a set of public keys that IdP consumers must use to validate a signed JWT.

## Why

Our current discovery process for AWS resources requires multiple steps before the user gets to the "aha moment".

For example, to set up an RDS DB the user must do the following:
- enter database name
- enter Database endpoint, port, resource id and AWS Account ID
- start a Database Agent by running a shell script (`database-install.sh`) in a EC2 instance
- create an IAM Policy
- add Database User and Database Name to the current user's traits
- user can connect to this Database

Configuring the IAM Policy, installing the Database Agent or setting up the traits the is sometimes challenging and we lose users before they get the "aha moment".

Using AWS OIDC Integration allows Teleport services to call AWS API methods to obtain most of this information instead of asking the user.
## How

AWS allows the [set up](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_create_oidc.html) of an IdP using OIDC providers.
Each provider has a set of roles, which limit their access.

Turning Teleport into an OIDC IdP, and asking the user to create a new OIDC IdP that consumes the Teleport OIDC endpoints, allows us to easily call AWS API endpoints to, for instance, list RDS instances and their details.

When configuring the provider, we'll need an AWS Role which Teleport uses to issue API Calls.

To store the configuration above, we'll create a new resource Kind: `Integration`.
It'll leverage the `subkind` prop to distinguish future integrations.

Multiple AWS Integrations might exist in the same cluster.

For security reasons, AWS stores a thumbprint associated with the CA that issued the HTTPS cert for Teleport.
If Teleport moves to another CA, then AWS will no longer accept calls from Teleport.
When that happens, a Cluster Alert is created informing the user about it and asking them to reset the thumbprint in AWS.

More information about this in the Security section.

### High Level Flow
Simplified flow of interactions between User, Teleport and AWS:

```

#### User's Point of View
When a user adds a new AWS Integration, they will go through the following.
Users will also be asked to set up an AWS integration when adding RDS databases in Discover flow.

1. User is prompted to setup an OIDC Identity Provider pointing to its Teleport instance's url.
2. User opens AWS, selects IAM and then, under `Access Management`, selects `Identity providers`.
3. Configures the Teleport instance as an OIDC IdP:
   1. Clicks `Add provider` of type `OpenID Connect`.
   2. Fills in the Provider URL as provided by the Discover Wizard.
   3. Fills in the Audience as provided by the Discover Wizard `discover.teleport`.
4. The user is then asked to enter the Thumbprint in Teleport, to ensure the user entered the correct `Provider URL`.
5. Configures the role associated with that IdP
   1. The user is asked to create or assign an existing role.
   2. The role's `Policies` must be filled with the required Policies (described down below).
   3. The role's `Trust relationships` must target the Identity Provider they just created (described down below).
6. The user will be greeted with a message in Teleport saying that the configuration was successful.

To ease the necessary manual steps, the Discover wizard will provide a small video demoing what the user must do for the previous steps.

At this point, the integration is configured and the user is able to discover RDS DBs without leaving Teleport.

To do so, when trying to add a RDS Database, they will be asked to select which AWS Integration to use.
If there's only one AWS Integration, that it will be selected without user's interaction to reduce the required steps.

#### System's Point of View
The first interaction between AWS and Teleport happens when the user clicks on `Get Thumbprint` (step 4 of the User's Point of View flow).
This will trigger a request started by AWS to Teleport hitting the OpenID Configuration endpoint and subsequently the JSON Web Key Set endpoint.

After this step, when the user tries to list RDS DBs, Teleport generates a token and issues the API call.

To generate a token, Teleport creates a JWT with the claims described [below](#openid-configuration) and the configured role, and signs it with the private key (the public is provided in the public JWKS endpoint).

AWS receives the request and validates the token against the public key provided by OIDC IdP (ie, Teleport) at the `jwks_uri`.
If authenticated and authorized for the api call, AWS returns the response to the API call.

### Implementation Details

#### Signing Key
One of the requirements to be an OIDC provider is to provide the public key in a known HTTP endpoint and sign a JSON object (with claims) with the private key.

We'll create a new CA: OIDCCA.
This will be similar to the SAML IdP CA.
It'll use RS256.

A single signing key will be used for this flow even if multiple AWS integrations are created (eg, multiple regions).

#### HTTP Endpoints
The following endpoints will be used during OIDC IdP set up:

##### OpenID Configuration
According to the [spec](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html#ProviderConfig) the Identity Provider must provide an endpoint at `<providerURL>/.well-known/openid-configuration` that returns the provider's configuration.

So, a new endpoint at `<proxyPublicAddr>/.well-known/openid-configuration` will be created that returns the following JSON:
```
200 OK

{
  "issuer": "https://proxy.example.com", 
  "jwks_uri": "https://proxy.example.com/.well-known/jwks-oidc",
  "claims": ["iss", "sub", "obo", "aud", "jti", "iat", "exp", "nbf"],
  "id_token_signing_alg_values_supported": ["RS256"],
  "response_types_supported": ["id_token"],
  "scopes_supported": ["openid"],
  "subject_types_supported": ["public", "pairwise"]
}
```

- Issuer: the proxy's public address
- JWKS URI: the endpoint where the provider returns the public keys.
- Claims Supported: a list of supported claims that the OpenID Provider (ie, Teleport) MAY be able to supply values for when issuing a token:
  - `iss`: the issuer identity, on our case it will be the same as the `issuer` key.
  - `sub`: identifies the subject of the token, in our case it will contain the Teleport proxy system `system:proxy`
  - `obo`: identifies the Teleport username that requested the token prefixed by `user:`
  - `aud`: the audience for the token, on our case it will be the same as the `audience` defined when configuring the OIDC IdP in AWS (step 3.3 for the User's Point of View).
  - `jti`: is the token id (UUIDv4).
  - `iat`: unix epoch time of when the token was issued.
  - `exp`: unix epoch time of when the token is no longer valid (expired).
  - `nbf`: unix epoch time which indicates when the token began to be valid.
- ID Token Signing Algorithm Values Supported: a list of supported signing algorithms to assist during token validation.
- Scopes Supported: a list of scopes to be used, on our case it will only contain the required one: `openid`.
- Subject Types Supported: a list of supported subject types:
  - `public`: we can either return clear text version of the subject (user names) or
  - `pairwise`: we can return a hash of the subject's identity (to hide their email, for instance)

##### JSON Web Key Sets
This endpoint returns a list of public keys (usually only one key, except for periods of key rotation).

This endpoint URI must be equal to `jwks_uri` defined in the previous section.

As an example, `https://proxy.example.com/.well-known/jwks-oidc`.

It should return the following:

```
200 OK

{
  "keys": [
    {
      "kty": "RSA",
      "alg": "RS256",
      "n": "<public key value>",
      "e": "AQAB"
    }
  ]
}
```

This must respect the RFC7517 (eg of a key can be found at https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7517#appendix-A.1).

Obtaining this key should be possible using
```golang
GetCertAuthority(
	ctx,
	types.CertAuthID{
		Type:       types.OIDCSigner, // new key type
		DomainName: clusterName,
	},
	false /*loadKeys*/,
)
```

#### AWS Role for Teleport OIDC IdP

The user will create or associate an AWS Role to the Teleport OIDC IdP.

As an example, we the following is the required policy to list RDS DBs (including Aurora clusters):
```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Actions": [
				"rds:DescribeDBClusters",
				"rds:DescribeDBInstances"
	        ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

This AWS Role must trust Teleport as an IdP.
To do so, the user must add the following Trusted relationship:
```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "Federated": "arn:aws:iam::0123456789012:oidc-provider/proxy.example.com"
            },
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity",
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "proxy.example.com:aud": "discover.teleport"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

### UX

#### Web flow
Described [above](#user_s-point-of-view).

#### Web API
Integration resource will have the usual CRUD operations via Web API.
The only updatable field is `aws_role_arn`.

HTTP API:
```
Methods:
GET .../integration
GET .../integration/:id
POST .../integration
PUT .../integration/:id
DELETE .../integration/:id
```
JSON representation:
```json
{
	"name": "myaws",
	"subkind": "aws-oidc"
	"subkindData": {
		"aws_role_arn": "arn:aws:123:TeleportOIDC"
	}
}
```

In order to call an Integration action, we'll create a new Web API endpoint:
```
--->
POST .../integration/:id/action/aws-oidc-list-databases
{}

<---
{
    "status": "success",
    "response": {
        "items": [
            {
                "status": "available",
                "name": "marcodbtest",
                "iamAuth": "true",
                "engine": "postgres",
                "engineVersion": "15.2",
                "masterUsername": "postgres",
                "tags": [],
                "arn": "arn:aws:rds:us-east-1:<accid>:db:marcodbtest",
                "addr": "marcodbtest.<someid>.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com",
                "port": "5432"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

This will generate a new token for the Integration `:id` and then call the `aws-oidc-list-databases` method which maps to a method that will do two AWS API Calls:
- `rds describe-db-instances`
- `rds describe-db-clusters`

The response contains the following fields:
- `status`: reports the result of calling the integration (other errors will come as usual: http status code)
- `response`: specific to the requested action

Pagination/Offset and search capabilities are out of scope for now.

#### CLI
Users can also create/update the resource using `tctl`.

The only updatable field is `aws_role_arn`.

`tctl`:

```
$ tctl get integrations
kind: integration
subkind: aws-oidc
version: v1
metadata:
	name: some-name
spec:
	aws_role_arn: arn:aws:123:TeleportOIDC

$ tctl get integration/myaws
kind: integration
subkind: aws-oidc
version: v1
metadata:
	name: some-name
spec:
	aws_role_arn: arn:aws:123:TeleportOIDC

$ tctl create aws-integration.yaml
```

Resource representation as `yaml`:
```yaml
kind: integration
subkind: aws-oidc
version: v1
metadata:
	name: myaws
spec:
	aws_role_arn: arn:aws:123:TeleportOIDC
```

#### IaC - Terraform
A new resource `Integration` must be created to allow for the Integration management from the Terraform provider.

#### IaC - Kube Operator
A new resource `Integration` must be created to allow for the Integration management from the Kube Operator.

#### IaC - Helm Charts
No change will be made to the Helm Charts because there's no new configuration changes.

### Security

#### Rotation
JWT Signing keys can be rotated using `tctl auth rotate --type=oidc`.

JWKS endpoint returns a list of public keys, so the old and the new key are provided for a seamless migration.

#### MITM between AWS and Teleport

During the initial set up, AWS records a [thumbprint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_create_oidc_verify-thumbprint.html) for the provider.

This thumbprint is the hex-encoded SHA-1 hash value of the top intermediate CA that signed the certificate used by Teleport to make its keys available (this is the `jwks_uri`'s domain).

If an attacker is able to control AWS's DNS resolvers and obtain a valid certificate from the top intermediate CA that signed the certificate, then they might be able to impersonate Teleport and AWS might accept requests from the attacker.

However, assuming the AWS's DNS resolvers are controlled by an attacker is a scenario we should not focus on this RFD.

#### AWS Calls from unauthorized Teleport Users
We'll be able to call `DescribeDBInstances/Clusters` AWS endpoint, however we must ensure that this is protected by RBAC.

In order to do so, we'll add a new verb: `use`.
This verb defines whether the user can use an integration's action.

The user needs the following rules in order to call an external integration endpoint:

```yaml
kind: role
metadata:
  name: editor
spec:
  allow:
    rules:
    - resources:
      - integration
      verbs:
      - use
```
