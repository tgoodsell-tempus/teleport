// The image validation is only invoked when we are in a maintenance window and
// the target version is different than our current version. In regular usage we
// are called only once per update. However, Kubernetes controllers failure mode
// is usually infinite retry loop. If something fails after the image validation,
// we might get called in a loop indefinitely. To mitigate the impact of such
// failure, ValidateAndResolveDigest should cache its result.

// ValidateAndResolveDigest resolves the image digest and always return the
// image is valid. Using this validator makes you vulnerable in case of image
// registry compromise.
