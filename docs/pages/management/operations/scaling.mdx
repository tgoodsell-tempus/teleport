This section explains the recommended configuration settings for large-scale
deployments of Teleport.

<ScopedBlock scope="cloud">

For Teleport Cloud customers, the settings in this guide are configured
automatically.

(!docs/pages/includes/cloud/call-to-action.mdx!)

## Prerequisites

- Teleport v(=teleport.version=) Open Source or Enterprise.

## Hardware recommendations

Set up Teleport with a [High Availability configuration](../../reference/backends.mdx).

| Scenario | Max Recommended Count | Proxy | Auth Server | AWS Instance Types |
| - | - | - | - | - |
| Teleport SSH Nodes connected to Auth Service | 10,000 | 2x  4 vCPUs, 8GB RAM | 2x 8 vCPUs, 16GB RAM | m4.2xlarge |
| Teleport SSH Nodes connected to Auth Service | 50,000 | 2x  4 vCPUs, 16GB RAM | 2x 8 vCPUs, 16GB RAM | m4.2xlarge |
| Teleport SSH Nodes connected to Proxy Service through reverse tunnels | 10,000 | 2x 4 vCPUs, 8GB RAM | 2x 8 vCPUs, 16+GB RAM | m4.2xlarge |

## Auth and Proxy Configuration

Upgrade Teleport's connection limits from the default connection limit of `15000`
to `65000`.

```yaml
# Teleport Auth and Proxy
teleport:
  connection_limits:
    max_connections: 65000
    max_users: 1000
```

## Kernel parameters

Tweak Teleport's systemd unit parameters to allow a higher amount of open
files:

```txt
[Service]
LimitNOFILE=65536
```

Verify that Teleport's process has high enough file limits:

```code
$ cat /proc/$(pidof teleport)/limits
# Limit                     Soft Limit           Hard Limit           Units
# Max open files            65536                65536                files
```

## DynamoDB configuration

When using Teleport with DynamoDB, we recommend using on-demand provisioning.
This allow DynamoDB to scale with cluster load.

For customers that can not use on-demand provisioning, we recommend at least
250 WCU and 100 RCU for 10k clusters.

## etcd

When using Teleport with etcd, we recommend you do the following.

- For performance, use the fastest SSDs available and ensure low-latency network connectivity
  between etcd peers. See the [etcd Hardware
  recommendations guide](https://etcd.io/docs/v3.5/op-guide/hardware/) for more
  details.
- For debugging, ingest etcd's Prometheus metrics and visualize them over
  time using a dashboard. See the [etcd Metrics
  guide](https://etcd.io/docs/v3.5/metrics) for more
  details.

During an incident, we may ask you to run `etcdctl`, test that you can run the
following command successfully.

```code
etcdctl \
    --write-out=table \
    --cacert=/path/to/ca.cert \
    --cert=/path/to/cert \
    --key=/path/to/key.pem \
    --endpoints=127.0.0.1:2379 \
    endpoint status
```
