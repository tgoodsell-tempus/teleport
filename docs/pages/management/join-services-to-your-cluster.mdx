title: Join Services to your Teleport Cluster
description: How to register the Proxy Service, Database Service, and other Telepoert services with your cluster.
---

A **Teleport service** manages access to resources in your infrastructure, such
as Kubernetes clusters, Windows desktops, internal web applications, and
databases. 

There are multiple methods you can use to join a Teleport process to your
cluster in order to run Teleport services, including an instance of the Proxy
Service. Choose the method that best suits your network topology or cloud
provider:

|Method|Description|When to use|
|------|-----------|-----------|
|[EC2 Identity Document](./register-services/register-services-aws-ec2.mdx)|A Teleport process running on an EC2 instance authenticates to your cluster via a signed EC2 identity instance identity document.|Your service is running on EC2.|
|[AWS IAM](./register-services/register-services-aws-iam.mdx)|A Teleport process uses AWS credentials to join the cluster, whether running on EC2 or not.|At least some of your infrastructure runs on AWS and your Teleport cluster is self hosted.|
|[Join Token](./register-services/register-services-join-token.mdx)|A Teleport process presents a join token provided when starting the service.|There is no other supported method for your cloud provider.|
[Join Token via the Auth Service](./register-services/register-services-auth-service.mdx)|The Teleport process performs the join token method, but connects via the Auth Service instead of the Proxy Service.|It is not possible to use the regular join token method due to the constraints of your network.|
