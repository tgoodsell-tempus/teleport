title: Joining Services via AWS IAM Role
description: Use the IAM join method to add services to your Teleport cluster on AWS
---

This guide will explain how to use the **IAM join method** to configure Teleport
services and Proxy Service instances to join your Teleport cluster without sharing
any secrets when they are running in AWS.

The IAM join method is available to any Teleport service running anywhere with
access to IAM credentials, such as an EC2 instance with an attached IAM role.
No specific permissions or IAM policy is required: an IAM role with no attached
policies is sufficient. No IAM credentials are required on the Teleport Auth Service.

There are two additional methods you can use to join your services to a Teleport
cluster.

The **EC2 join method** is available in self-hosted versions of Teleport.
It is available to any Teleport service instance running on an EC2 instance.
Only one Teleport service instance per EC2 instance may use the EC2 join method.

IAM credentials with `ec2:DescribeInstances` permissions are required on
your Teleport Auth Service. No IAM credentials are required on the services or
Proxies.

You can also configure services running in AWS to join a cluster via **secret tokens**,
which is useful when you don't want to rely on AWS-specific APIs.

The IAM join method will not work if TLS is terminated at a load balancer in
front of your Teleport Proxy Service unless the service using this method is
connecting directly to the Auth Service.

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- An AWS EC2 instance to host a Teleport service, with the Teleport binary
  installed.

(!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)

## Step 1/4. Set up AWS IAM credentials
Every service or Proxy using the IAM method to join your Teleport cluster needs AWS
IAM credentials in order to call the `sts:GetCallerIdentity` API. No specific
IAM policy or permissions are needed. Any IAM user or role can call this API.

If running your service on an EC2 instance, it is sufficient to attach any IAM
role to the instance. To attach an IAM role from the EC2 dashboard, select
`Actions > Security > Modify IAM role`.
It is not necessary for the role to have any attached IAM policies at all.
If your instance does not otherwise need AWS credentials, it is preferred to
create and attach an emtpy role with no attached policies.

You can also provide the IAM credentials to Teleport through a shared
configuration file or environment variables. For details, see the following guide:

[Specifying Credentials](https://aws.github.io/aws-sdk-go-v2/docs/configuring-sdk/#specifying-credentials)

## Step 2/4. Create the AWS service joining token
Under the hood, services will prove that they are running in your AWS account by
sending a pre-signed `sts:GetCallerIdentity` request to the Teleport Auth Server. The
service's identity must match an allow rule configured in your AWS service joining
token.

Create the following `token.yaml` with an `allow` rule specifying your AWS
account and the ARN that your service's identity must match.

```
# token.yaml
kind: token
version: v2
metadata:
  # the token name is not a secret because instances must prove that they are
  # running in your AWS account to use this token
  name: iam-token
spec:
  # use the minimal set of roles required
  roles: [service]

  # set the join method allowed for this token
  join_method: iam

  allow:
  # specify the AWS account which services may join from
  - aws_account: "111111111111"
  # multiple allow rules are supported
  - aws_account: "222222222222"
  # aws_arn is optional and allows you to restrict the IAM role of joining services
  - aws_account: "333333333333"
    aws_arn: "arn:aws:sts::333333333333:assumed-role/teleport-node-role/i-*"
```

The token name `iam-token` is just an example and can be any value you want to
use, as long as you use the same value for `join_params.token_name` in Step 3.

The optional `aws_arn` field in the allow rules supports wildcard characters:
- `*` to match any combination of characters
- `?` to match any single character

See the
[IAM docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_resource.html)
for more details on the ARN format.

You can check what your AWS identity looks like by running
`aws sts get-caller-identity` on the
[AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/).

Run `tctl create -f token.yaml` to create the token.

## Step 3/4. Configure your services
The IAM join method can be used for Teleport services running the SSH, Proxy,
Kubernetes, Application, or Database Service.

Configure your Teleport service with a custom `teleport.yaml` file. Use the
`join_params` section with `token_name` matching your token created in Step 2
and `method: iam` as shown in the following example config:

```
# /etc/teleport.yaml
version: v3
teleport:
  join_params:
    token_name: iam-token
    method: iam
  proxy_server: https://teleport.example.com:443
ssh_service:
  enabled: yes
auth_service:
  enabled: no
proxy_service:
  enabled: no
```

## Step 4/4. Launch your Teleport service

(!docs/pages/includes/aws-credentials.mdx!)

(!docs/pages/includes/start-teleport.mdx!)

Once you have started Teleport, confirm that your service is able to connect to and
join your cluster.
