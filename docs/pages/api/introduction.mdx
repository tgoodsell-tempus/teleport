The Teleport Auth API provides a gRPC API for remotely interacting with a Teleport Auth server.

Teleport has a public [Go client](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gravitational/teleport/api/client)
to programatically interact with the API. [tsh and tctl](../reference/cli.mdx) use the same API.

## Go client

Here is what you can do with the Go Client:
 - Integrating with external tools, which we have already done 
   for [several tools](../access-controls/access-request-plugins/index.mdx),
   such as Slack, Jira, and Mattermost.
 - Writing a program/bot to manage Access Requests automatically, based on your use case. One idea
   is to allow/deny developer requests based on their currently assigned tasks.
 - Performing CRUD actions on resources, such as `roles`, `auth connectors`, and `provisioning tokens`.
 - Dynamically configuring Teleport.

Create an API client in 3 minutes with the [Getting Started
Guide](./getting-started.mdx).

Follow our [Access Request Plugin Guide](./access-plugin.mdx) for a tour of
Teleport's API libraries and develop a minimal working example.
