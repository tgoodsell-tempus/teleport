This guide explains how to set up GitHub Single Sign On (SSO) so you can
automatically map teams in your GitHub organization to users and roles in
Teleport.

## Prerequisites

- A GitHub organization with at least one team. <ScopedBlock scope="oss">This organization must not have external SSO set up, or Teleport
will refuse to create the GitHub authentication connector.</ScopedBlock><ScopedBlock scope={["enterprise", "cloud"]}>This organization can be hosted
from either GitHub Cloud or GitHub Enterprise Server.</ScopedBlock>
- Teleport role with access to maintaining `github` resources for using `tctl` from the Desktop. This is available in the default `editor` role.

## Step 1/3. Create a GitHub OAuth app

Create and register a GitHub OAuth App. When you do so, ensure that your OAuth
App's "Authentication callback URL" is the following:

```
https://PROXY_ADDRESS/v1/webapi/github/
```

`PROXY_ADDRESS` must be <ScopedBlock scope={["oss", "enterprise"]}>the public
address of the Teleport Proxy Service</ScopedBlock><ScopedBlock
scope="cloud">your Teleport Cloud tenant address</ScopedBlock>.

Instructions for creating a GitHub OAuth app are available here:

[Creating an OAuth App](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app)

## Step 2/3. Create a GitHub authentication connector

Define a GitHub authentication connector by creating a file called `github.yaml`
with the following content:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Open Source" scope="oss">

```yaml
kind: github
version: v3
metadata:
  # Connector name that will be used with `tsh --auth=github login`
  name: github
spec:
  # Client ID of your GitHub OAuth App
  client_id: <client-id>
  # Client secret of your GitHub OAuth App
  client_secret: <client-secret>
  # Connector display name that will be shown on the Web UI login screen
  display: GitHub
  # Callback URL that will be called after successful authentication
  redirect_url: https://<proxy-address>/v1/webapi/github/callback
  # Mapping of org/team memberships onto allowed roles
  teams_to_roles:
    - organization: octocats # GitHub organization name
      team: admins # GitHub team name within that organization
      # Maps octocats/admins to the "access" Teleport role
      roles:
        - access
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Enterprise / Cloud" scope={["enterprise", "cloud"]}>

```yaml
kind: github
version: v3
metadata:
  # Connector name that will be used with `tsh --auth=github login`
  name: github
spec:
  # Client ID of your GitHub OAuth App
  client_id: <client-id>
  # Client secret of your GitHub OAuth App
  client_secret: <client-secret>
  # Connector display name that will be shown on the Web UI login screen
  display: GitHub
  # URL of your GitHub Enterprise Server instance (if applicable)
  endpoint_url: https://<github-enterprise-server-address>
  # Callback URL that will be called after successful authentication
  redirect_url: https://<proxy-address>/v1/webapi/github/callback
  # Mapping of org/team memberships onto allowed roles
  teams_to_roles:
    - organization: octocats # GitHub organization name
      team: admins # GitHub team name within that organization
      # Maps octocats/admins to the "access" Teleport role
      roles:
        - access
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The values of `client_id`, `client_secret`, and `redirect_url` come from the
GitHub OAuth App you created earlier.

Teleport will request only the `read:org` OAuth scope. Read more about OAuth scopes in GitHub's documentation:

[GitHub OAuth scopes](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/understanding-scopes-for-oauth-apps/)

Finally, create the connector using `tctl`:

```code
$ tctl create github.yaml
# authentication connector "github" has been created
```

<Admonition type="tip">
  When going through the GitHub authentication flow for the first time,
  the application must be granted access to all organizations that are
  present in the "teams to logins" mapping, otherwise Teleport will not be
  able to determine team memberships for these organizations.
</Admonition>

After a user authenticates, Teleport will add the user's GitHub username to their
`internal.logins` trait for their Teleport session. The preset `access` role has this
trait variable configured to include the GitHub user as an authorized SSH login.
Here is an example role configuration snippet using the trait variable:

```yaml
  allow:
    # List of allowed SSH logins
    logins: ['{{internal.logins}}', ubuntu, debian]

    # List of node labels that users can SSH into
    node_labels:
      '*': '*'
```

## Step 3/3. Configure authentication preference

Configure the Teleport Auth Service to enable the GitHub authentication
connector.

Obtain your existing `cluster_auth_preference` resource:

```code
$ tctl get cap > cap.yaml
```

If you have not defined a `cluster_auth_preference`, `cap.yaml` will be blank.

Ensure that `cap.yaml` includes the following content:

```yaml
kind: cluster_auth_preference
metadata:
  name: cluster-auth-preference
spec:
  type: github
  webauthn:
    rp_id: 'example.teleport.sh'
version: v2
```

For `rp_id`, use the public address of your <ScopedBlock scope={["oss", "enterprise"]}>Teleport Proxy Service</ScopedBlock><ScopedBlock scope="cloud">Teleport Cloud tenant</ScopedBlock>.

Create the resource:

```code
$ tctl create -f cap.yaml
# cluster auth preference has been updated
```

<Details scope={["enterprise", "oss"]} scopeOnly={false} opened title="Static configuration file">

You can also edit your Teleport configuration file to include the following:

```yaml
# Snippet from /etc/teleport.yaml
auth_service:
  authentication:
    type: github
```
</Details>

You can now log in with Teleport using GitHub SSO.

Run the following to log out of Teleport and log in again using GitHub SSO.

<ScopedBlock scope={["oss", "enterprise"]}>

```code
$ tsh logout
# Logged out all users from all proxies.
$ tsh login --proxy=tele.example.com
If browser window does not open automatically, open it by clicking on the link:
 http://127.0.0.1:56334/6bf976e6-a4be-4898-94eb-8a7b01af2158
```

</ScopedBlock>
<ScopedBlock scope={["cloud"]}>

```code
$ tsh logout
# Logged out all users from all proxies.
$ tsh login --proxy=mytenant.teleport.sh
If browser window does not open automatically, open it by clicking on the link:
 http://127.0.0.1:56334/6bf976e6-a4be-4898-94eb-8a7b01af2158
```

</ScopedBlock>

When you sign in for the first time, you will see a prompt to authorize your
GitHub OAuth app:

![GitHub SSO authorization view](../../../img/github-sso-auth-screen.jpg)

After logging in successfully, you will see the following:

![Login success view](../../../img/login-success.jpg)


You will receive the details of your user session within the CLI. 

<ScopedBlock scope={["oss", "enterprise"]}>

```code
> Profile URL:        https://tele.example.com:443
  Logged in as:       jeff
  Cluster:            tele.example.com
  Roles:              access
  Logins:             jeff, ubuntu, debian, -teleport-internal-join
  Kubernetes:         enabled
  Kubernetes users:   dev
  Kubernetes groups:  developer
  Valid until:        2023-03-08 17:13:50 -0600 CST [valid for 7h51m0s]
  Extensions:         permit-port-forwarding, permit-pty, private-key-policy
```

</ScopedBlock>

<ScopedBlock scope={["cloud"]}>

```code
> Profile URL:        https://mytenant.teleport.sh:443
  Logged in as:       jeff
  Cluster:            mytenant.teleport.sh
  Roles:              access
  Logins:             jeff, ubuntu, debian, -teleport-internal-join
  Kubernetes:         enabled
  Kubernetes users:   dev
  Kubernetes groups:  developer
  Valid until:        2023-03-08 17:13:50 -0600 CST [valid for 7h51m0s]
  Extensions:         permit-port-forwarding, permit-pty, private-key-policy

```
