<Admonition type="warning">
Device Trust is currently in Preview mode.

Device Trust requires Teleport Enterprise.
</Admonition>

Device Trust allows Teleport admins to enforce the use of trusted devices.
Resources protected by the device mode "required" will enforce the use of a
trusted device, in addition to establishing the user's identity and enforcing
the necessary roles. Furthermore, users using a trusted device leave audit
trails that include the device's information.

The device trust preview works only with macOS devices and supports the
following Teleport features:

- SSH access enforcement
- Database access enforcement
- Kubernetes access enforcement

Support for other operating systems and access features is planned for upcoming
Teleport versions.

## Concepts

Device Trust uses the Secure Enclave in macOS devices to store a device private
key. That key is used to solve device challenges issued by the Teleport Auth
Server, proving the identity of the trusted device.

Device management is divided into two separate phases: inventory management and
device enrollment.

**Inventory management** is performed by a device admin. In this step, devices
are registered or removed from Teleport. For example, this happens when the IT
department of your company acquires new devices, or retires devices from use.

**Device enrollment** is performed either by a device admin or by the end-user,
at your discretion. This is the step that creates the Secure Enclave private key
in the device and register its public key counterpart with the Teleport Auth
Server. Enrollment has to run in the actual device that you want to enroll. For
example, this happens when a user gets a new device for the first time, or when
IT prepares a new device for a user. Enrollment only needs to happen once per
user/device combination.

<Admonition type="tip" title="Enrollment">
Device enrollment is key in correctly identifying a device throughout its
lifetime. The more trusted the enrollment operator, the better the ongoing
guarantees that the device itself is trustworthy.
</Admonition>

The tie between the device inventory and enrollment is a device enrollment
token. A device enrollment token needs to be created by a device admin and sent
to the person performing the enrollment ceremony. The token ties the actual
device being enrolled to the expected device in the inventory, adding an extra
layer of protection.

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/commercial-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- A signed and notarized `tsh` binary for enrollment.
  [Download the macOS tsh installer](../../installation.mdx#macos).
- A macOS device to register and enroll.

## Step 1/2. Register a trusted device

The `tctl` tool is used to manage the device inventory. A device admin is
responsible for managing devices, adding new devices to the inventory and
removing devices that are no longer in use.

A role that grants permissions for the `device` resource is necessary to manage
the inventory. Save the yaml below as `device-admin.yaml` and create it in your
cluster:

```yaml
version: v6
kind: role
metadata:
  name: device-admin
spec:
  allow:
    rules:
    - resources: ["device"]
      verbs:
      - create
      - read
      - list
      - update
      - delete
      - create_enroll_token
      - enroll
```

```code
$ tctl create -f device-admin.yaml
role 'device-admin' has been created
```

<Admonition type="tip" title="Editor Role">
For clusters created using Teleport v12 or newer, the builtin role `editor` has
the necessary permissions to manage devices. For production setups a separate
role is still recommended.
</Admonition>

Note that in addition to the usual CRUD verbs (create, read, list, update and
delete), we have also included `create_enroll_token` and `enroll`. The
`create_enroll_token` verb is necessary to execute the `tctl devices enroll`
command; `enroll` is necessary to execute `tsh device enroll`. Both are
demonstrated in the following section.

Make sure your user has the `device-admin` role:

```code
$ tctl edit users/alice
```

```diff
kind: user
metadata:
  name: alice
  # unrelated fields omitted.
spec:
  roles:
  - access
+ - device-admin # add this line
version: v2
```

Relogin to fetch updated certificates:

```code
$ tsh logout; tsh login --proxy=example.com --user=alice
```

Having the necessary permissions, let's add a device to the inventory. Replace
the `$SERIAL` below with your macOS device serial number (visible under Apple ->
"About This Mac" -> "Serial number", or use the command below).

```code
$ SERIAL="$(ioreg -c IOPlatformExpertDevice -d 2 | grep -i IOPlatformSerialNumber | awk -F'"' '{print $4}')"
$ tctl devices add --os=macos --asset-tag="$SERIAL"
Device (=devicetrust.asset_tag=)/macOS added to the inventory
```

View registered devices:

```code
$ tctl devices ls
Asset Tag    OS    Enroll Status Device ID
------------ ----- ------------- ------------------------------------
(=devicetrust.asset_tag=) macOS not enrolled  (=devicetrust.device_id=)
```

A registered device is a device that Teleport knows about. Once a registered
device is enrolled, it becomes a trusted device.

<Admonition type="tip" title="Removing Devices">
A device that is no longer in use may be removed using `tctl devices rm
--device-id=<ID>` or `tctl devices rm --asset-tag=<SERIAL>`.
</Admonition>

## Step 2/2. Enroll a trusted device

A registered device becomes a trusted device after it goes through the
enrollment ceremony. Enrollment exchanges an enrollment token, created by a
device admin, for the opportunity to enroll the corresponding device.

macOS enrollments are tied to the current user in the device. If the same device
is handed to a new user, they will need to perform enrollment again.

To create an enrollment token run the following command, where `--asset-tag` is
the serial number of the device we want to enroll.

```code
$ tctl devices enroll --asset-tag="(=devicetrust.asset_tag=)"
Run the command below on device "(=devicetrust.asset_tag=)" to enroll it:
tsh device enroll --token=(=devicetrust.enroll_token=)
```

To perform the enrollment ceremony, using the device specified above, type the
command printed by `tctl devices enroll`:

```code
$ tsh device enroll --token=(=devicetrust.enroll_token=)
Device "(=devicetrust.asset_tag=)"/macOS enrolled

$ tsh logout; tsh login --proxy=example.com --user=alice # fetch new certificates
```

The device above is now a trusted device.

## Optional: Cluster-wide trusted device enforcement

Cluster-wide configuration enforces trusted device access at the cluster level.
It can be configured with the following three modes of operation, represented
by the `device_trust.mode` authentication setting:

- `off` - disables device trust. Device authentication is not performed and
  device-aware audit logs are absent.
- `optional` - enables device authentication and device-aware audit, but doesn't
  require a trusted device to access resources.
- `required` - enables device authentication and device-aware audit.
  Additionally, it requires a trusted device for all SSH, Database and
  Kubernetes connections.

Enterprise clusters run in `optional` mode by default. Changing the mode to
`required` will enforce a trusted device for all SSH, Database and Kubernetes
accesses.

<Admonition type="warning" title="Web UI">
The Web UI is not capable of trusted device access during the device trust
preview. Only `tsh` and Teleport Connect are able to fulfill device mode
`required`.
</Admonition>

To enable device mode `required` update your configuration as follows:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Static Config">
Edit the Auth Server's `teleport.yaml` file:

```diff
auth_service:
  authentication:
    type: local
    second_factor: "on"
    webauthn:
      rp_id: example.com
    device_trust:
+     mode: "required" # add this line
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Dynamic resources">
Create a `cap.yaml` file or get the existing configuration using
`tctl get cluster_auth_preference`:

```diff
kind: cluster_auth_preference
version: v2
metadata:
  name: cluster-auth-preference
spec:
  type: local
  second_factor: "on"
  webauthn:
    rp_id: example.com
  device_trust:
+   mode: "required" # add this line
```

Update the configuration:

```code
$ tctl create -f cap.yaml
cluster auth preference has been updated
```

You can also edit this configuration directly:

```code
$ tctl edit cluster_auth_preference
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

SSH, Database and Kubernetes access without a trusted device is now forbidden.
For example, SSH access without a trusted device fails with the following error:

```code
$ tsh ssh server1
ERROR: ssh: rejected: administratively prohibited (unauthorized device)
```

<Admonition type="tip" title="Trusted Clusters">
It is possible to use [trusted
clusters](../../management/admin/trustedclusters.mdx) to limit the impact of
device mode `required`. A leaf cluster in mode `required` will enforce access to
all of its resources, without imposing the same restrictions to the root
cluster. Likewise, a root cluster will not enforce device trust on resources in
leaf clusters.
</Admonition>

## Optional: Role-based trusted device enforcement

Role-based configuration enforces trusted device access at the role level. It
can be configured with the `spec.options.device_trust_mode` (`required`,
`optional`, `off`) option and applies to the resources in its `allow` rules. It
works similar to [`require_session_mfa`](./per-session-mfa.mdx).

To enforce authenticated device checks for a specific role, update the role with the following:

```diff
kind: role
version: v6
metadata:
  name: example-role
spec:
  options:
    # require authenticated device check for this role
+   device_trust_mode: "required" # add this line
  allow:
    logins: ['admin']
    kubernetes_groups: ['edit']
    node_labels:
      '*': '*'
    ...

```

<Admonition type="tip" title="Per-role vs. Cluster-wide">
Per-role configuration let's you progressively block unauthorized device access,
and is useful for getting started with Teleport Device Trust.

Once all the devices used are enrolled in Teleport, cluster-wide
configuration will ensure every resources can only ever be accessed with a
trusted device.
</Admonition>

## Optional: Locking a device

Similar to [session and identity locking](./locking.mdx), a device can be locked
using `tctl lock`.

Locking blocks certificate issuance and ongoing or future accesses originating
from a locked device. Locking a device only works if device trust is enabled and
if the device is enrolled to Teleport.

Find a device ID to lock:

```code
$ tctl devices ls
Asset Tag     OS    Enroll Status   Device ID
------------ -----  ------------- ------------------------------------
(=devicetrust.asset_tag=)  macOS  enrolled     (=devicetrust.device_id=)
```

Lock a device:

```code
$ tctl lock --device (=devicetrust.device_id=) --ttl=12h
Created a lock with name "5444970a-39a0-4814-968d-e58b4a8fa686".
```

Now, if a user on that device tries to access an SSH server for example, Teleport will deny access:

```code
$ tsh ssh server1
ERROR: ssh: rejected: administratively prohibited (lock targeting Device:"(=devicetrust.device_id=)" is in force)
```

## Troubleshooting

### "binary missing signature or entitlements" on `tsh device enroll`

A signed and notarized `tsh` binary is necessary to enroll and use a a trusted
device. [Download the macOS tsh installer](../../installation.mdx#macos) to fix
the problem.

### "unauthorized device" errors using a trusted device

A signed and notarized `tsh` binary is necessary to use a trusted device. Make
sure to download and use the
[macOS tsh installer](../../installation.mdx#macos).

A trusted device needs to be registered and enrolled before it is recognized by
Teleport as such. Follow the [registration](#step-12-register-a-trusted-device)
and [enrollment steps](#step-22-enroll-a-trusted-device) and make sure to `tsh
logout` and `tsh login` after enrollment is done.
