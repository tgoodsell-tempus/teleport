## Introduction

Moderated Sessions allows Teleport administrators to define requirements for
other users to be present in a Server or Kubernetes Access session. Depending on
the requirements, these users can observe the session in real time, participate
in the session, and terminate the session at will.

In addition, Teleport administrators can [define rules](#join_sessions) that allow users to join each other's
sessions from `tsh` and the Web UI.

  Moderated Sessions requires Teleport Enterprise or Teleport Cloud.

### Use cases

Moderated Sessions are useful in the following scenarios:
- When you have stringent security requirements and need to have people watching
  over user-initiated sessions on a set of servers.
- When you want to share a terminal with someone else to be able to instruct or
  collaborate.

## Policies

Moderated Sessions makes use of RBAC policies to allow for fine grained control
over who can join a session and who is required to be present to start one.

The system is based around **require policies** and **allow policies**. 

Require policies define a set of conditions that must be a met for a session to
start or run. A minimum of one policy from each relevant role the user has must
match for the session to start.

Allow policies are used to define what sessions a user can join and under what
conditions they may join a session.

## Configuring Moderated Sessions

### `require_session_join`

#### Options

The following are required options for `require_session_join`:

|Option|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|`name`|String|The name of the require policy|
|`filter`|[Filter](#filters)|An expression that, if it evaluates to true for a given user, enables the user to be present in a Moderated Session|
|`kinds`|`[]`[Session kind](#session-kinds)|The kind of session that the policy applies to|
|`modes`|`[]`[Participant mode](#participant-modes)|The participant mode that applies to the user joining the Moderated Session under this policy|
|`count`|Integer|The number of users that need to match the filter expression to satisfy the policy|

The following fields are optional for `require_session_join`:

|Option|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|`on_leave`|[On leave](#on-leave)|The action to take when the policy is no longer satisfied|

#### Example

The policy below specifies that the `prod-access` role must have a minimum of
two users with the role `auditor` and the mode `moderator` present in the
session to start it. The policy applies to SSH and Kubernetes sessions only.

When a user with this require policy starts a session, it will be pending until
the policy is fulfilled. 

```yaml
kind: role
metadata:
  name: prod-access
spec:
  allow:
    require_session_join:
      - name: Auditor oversight
        filter: 'contains(user.spec.roles, "auditor")'
        kinds: ['k8s', 'ssh']
        modes: ['moderator']
        count: 2
```

#### Combining Policies

The authorizer applies require policies within a role together with an OR operator and the policies from each role with an AND operator. In practice, this means that for every role with at least one require policy, one of its policies must be met before a session can be started.

### `join_sessions`

#### Options

The following are required options for `join_sessions`:

|Option|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|`name`|String|The name of the allow policy|
|`roles`|[]String|A list of names of Teleport roles whose sessions this policy applies to. Active sessions created by users with these roles can be joined under this policy.|
|`kinds`|`[]`[Session kind](#session-kinds)|The kind of session that the policy applies to|
|`modes`|`[]`[Participant mode](#participant-modes)|The participant mode that applies to the user joining the session under this policy|

#### Example

The following allow policy attaches to the role `auditor` and allows one to
join SSH and Kubernetes sessions started by a user with the role `prod-access`
as a moderator or observer.

```yaml
kind: role
metadata:
  name: auditor
spec:
  allow:
    join_sessions:
      - name: Auditor oversight
        roles : ['prod-access']
        kinds: ['k8s', 'ssh']
        modes: ['moderator', 'observer']
```

### Filters

Filter expressions allow for more detailed control over the scope of an allow
policy or require policy.

Require policies can specify which users they consider as valid with a filter
expression. The filter context has a `user` object defined with the set fields
`roles` and `name`.

Here is an example of a filter expression that evaluates to true if the user is
Adam or if the user has the trait `cs-observe`:

```
equals(user.name, "adam") || contains(user.spec.roles, "cs-observe")
```

A filter expression is a string statement used to define logic based on a set of
input variables. The filter expressions follow a restricted subset of Go syntax
and supports the following functions and operators:

- `contains(set, item)`: Returns true if the item is in the set, otherwise
  false. The set can be a string or an array.
- `equals(a, b)`: Returns true if the two values are equal, otherwise returns
  false.
- `![expr]`: Negates a boolean expression.
- `[expr] && [expr]`: Performs a logical AND on two boolean expressions.
- `[expr] || [expr]`: Performs a logical OR on two boolean expressions.

### Session kinds

Require and allow policies have to specify which sessions they apply to. Valid
options are `ssh` and `k8s`.

- `ssh` policies apply to all SSH sessions on a node running the Teleport SSH server.
- `k8s` policies apply to all Kubernetes sessions on clusters connected to Teleport.

### Participant modes

A participant joining a session will always have one of three modes:

- `observer`: Allows read-only access to the session. You can view output but cannot control the session in any way nor send any input.
- `moderator`: Allows you to watch the session. You can view output and forcefully terminate or pause the session at any time, but can't send input.
- `peer`: Allows you to collaborate in the session. You can view output and send input.


When joining a session with `tsh join` or `tsh kube join`, a user can specify a
mode with the `--mode <mode>` flag , where the mode is one of `peer`,
`moderator` or `observer`. By default, the mode is `peer` for SSH and
`moderator` for Kubernetes sessions.

A participant may leave a session with the shortcut `^c` (Control + c) while in observer or
moderator mode. When in moderator mode, a participant may also forcefully
terminate the session at any point in time with the shortcut `t`.

### Require policy count

Require policies can have a variable amount of users that need to match the
filter expression in order to satisfy the policy. The `count` field of a require
policy is a positive integer value that specifies the minimum amount of users
this policy requires.

### On leave

The `on_leave` string option in require policies is used to define what happens when a moderator leaves a session, causing a policy to no longer be satisfied.

There are two possible actions to take in this scenario:
1. Terminate the session and disconnect all participants, corresponding to the `"terminate"` value.
2. Pause the session and stop any input/output streaming until the policy is satisfied again, corresponding to the `"pause"` value.

By default, Teleport treats an empty string in this field as the same as `terminate`.
That is, the session is terminated instantly and all participants are disconnected.

If all require policies attached to the session owner are set to `"pause"`, the session will instead pause
but the session will remain open. This discards all input from session participants and buffers the most recent output until the session can resume.

## Backwards compatibility with Server Access

Moderated Session RBAC controls were added to the role specification in version 5
(`version: v5` in the YAML definition).
Previously, Server Access did not include controls over which users can join a
session.
To avoid breaking functionality for users with only roles on v4 or older, RBAC
access checks will only be enforced if the user has at least one v5 role.

New roles will be created as v5 by default, and older roles can by updated with
`tctl` or from the Web UI by modifying the `version` field.

## MFA-based presence

When `per_session_mfa` is set to `true` via [role or cluster
settings](../../access-controls/guides/per-session-mfa.mdx), Teleport enforces
MFA-based presence checks for moderators. This requires that all moderators
wishing to join have a configured U2F or WebAuthn MFA token.

Every 30 seconds, Teleport will issue a prompt to the user in the terminal,
asking them to press their MFA token in the next 15 seconds. This will happen
continuously during the session and exists so that moderators are always present
and watching a given session.

If no MFA input is received within 60 seconds, the user is kicked from the
session which may pause it, if RBAC policies are no longer met.

## Session invites

When starting an interactive SSH or Kubernetes session using `tsh ssh` or `tsh
kube exec` respectively, one may supply a `--reason <reason>` and/or an
`--invited <users>` flag where `<reason>` is a string and `<users>` is a
comma-separated list of usernames.

This information can be picked up by a third party integration and may for
example be used to enable notifications over some external communication system.
