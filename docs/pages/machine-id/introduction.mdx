# Machine ID

Machine ID is a service that programmatically issues and renews short-lived
certificates to any service account (e.g., a CI/CD server) by retrieving
credentials from the Teleport Auth Service. This enables fine-grained
role-based access controls and audit.

Machine ID supports the following Teleport features:
 - [Server Access](./getting-started.mdx)
 - [Database Access](./guides/databases.mdx)
 - [Kubernetes Access](./guides/kubernetes.mdx) (*in Teleport v10.1*)
 - [Application Access](./guides/applications.mdx) (*in Teleport v10.1*)
   - Note: [AWS Console](../application-access/cloud-apis/aws-console.mdx) and API access is currently unsupported.
 - [Teleport API Access](../api/introduction.mdx)

These features are supported in Teleport Enterprise and Teleport Cloud.

The following features are **not** yet supported by Machine ID:
 - [Desktop Access](../desktop-access/introduction.mdx)
 - [User Impersonation](../access-controls/guides/impersonation.mdx): Machine 
   ID uses Role Impersonation which cannot be combined with User Impersonation
 - Multifactor authentication like [WebAuthn](../access-controls/guides/webauthn.mdx) and [Passwordless](../access-controls/guides/passwordless.mdx)
 - [AWS Console Access](../application-access/cloud-apis/aws-console.mdx)

TODO(russjones): Once we have a demo video for Machine ID, include it here.

## Demo

Let's create a bot and use the machine identity to connect to a server.
