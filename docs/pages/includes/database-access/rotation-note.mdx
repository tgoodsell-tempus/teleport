<Admonition type="note" title="Certificate Rotation">
  Teleport 10.0 introduced a new certificate authority that is only used by the Teleport Database Service.
  Older Teleport versions use a host certificate to sign Database Service certificates.

After upgrading to Teleport 10.0, the host certificate authority will still be used by the Database Service to maintain compatibility.
  The first [certificate rotation](../../management/operations/ca-rotation.mdx) will rotate host and database certificates.

New Teleport 10.0+ installations generate the database certificate authority when they first start, and are not affected
  by the rotation procedure described above.
