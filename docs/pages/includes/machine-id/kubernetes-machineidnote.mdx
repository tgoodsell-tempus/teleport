<Admonition type="note" title="Kubernetes Public Address Required for non-TLS Routing" scope={["oss", "enterprise"]} scopeOnly>
  For self-hosted Teleport Clusters that have non-TLS routing the Kubernetes public address must be set
  for Machine ID Kubernetes connections.
  To confirm the TLS routing mode check the `proxy.tls_routing_enabled` from this command with your proxy address.
  ```bash
  curl https://teleport.example.com:443/webapi/ping | jq
  ```

  The `kube_public_addr` is set within the `proxy_service` by administrators.

  ```yaml
  proxy_service:
    enabled: true
    kube_listen_addr: 0.0.0.0:3026
    kube_public_addr: teleport.example.com:3026
  ```
