# MacOS/Darwin variables for packaging, signing and notarizing.

# These are parameterized per environment, with `promote` for official
# releases and `build` for development testing. These environment names
# come from our configuration in GitHub Actions.

# Default environment name if not specified. This is currently for Drone
# which does not set `ENVIRONMENT_NAME`. Once migrated fully to GitHub
# actions, we should change this to `build` as the default.

# Developer "team" and keys.
# TEAMID is an Apple-assigned identifier for a developer. It has two keys,
# one for signing binaries (application) and one for signing packages/images
# (installer). The keys are identified by name per-environment which we use
# to extract the key IDs. Key names can be view by running `security find-identity`.
#
# NOTE: If you need to export the DEVELOPER_ID_{APPLICATION,INSTALLER}
# variables to the environment for a command, it should be done within the
# recipe containing the command using $(eval export DEVELOPER_ID_APPLICATION ...).
# This is so the `security` shell command is only run to extract the key ID
# if necessary. If exported at the top level, it will run every time `make`
# is run.
#
# e.g.
# pkg:
#         $(eval export DEVELOPER_ID_APPLICATION DEVELOPER_ID_INSTALLER)
#         ./build.assets/build-package.sh ...
